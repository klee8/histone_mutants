### Epichloe histone mutant analysis
#### Kate Lee, 2019

#### AIM:
- Differential expression analysis of Epichloe festucae Fl1_v3 genes in Epichloe histone mutants setB and clrD-infected ryegrass compared with wild type Epichloe festucae Fl1_v3 infected ryegrass.
- Differential expression analysis of Lolium perenne (ryegrass) genes in Epichloe histone mutants setB and clrD-infected ryegrass compared with wild type Epichloe festucae Fl1_v3 infected ryegrass
- Differential expression analysis of wild type Epichloe festucae Fl1_v3 in Lolium perenne 3 days after infection compared with Epichloe festucae Fl1_v3 culture (from earlier study, Dupont et al., 2015).


#### Overview:
- download raw data from SRA database
- QC data using trimmomatic
- count reads using Salmon
- DESeq2 for differential expression analysis
- identify core gene sets that are up or down regulated in both Epichloe mutants compared with wild type Epichloe Fl1
- identify core gene sets that are up or down regulated in ryegrass infected with both Epichloe mutants compared with ryegrass infecgted with wild type Epichloe Fl1
